            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>HAuing confeſſed that <hi>there is a God:</hi> it followeth conſequently, that wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe him to bee iuſt,<note place="margin">Hebr. 11.6.</note> a rewarder of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man according to his deſerts. Now the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts haue a ſecond ſhift, to confirme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in their wickedneſſe, and that is, to deny the immortalitie of the ſoule; affirming that it is all one with the bodie, and that it dieth with the ſame: which aſſertion, or rather blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, is moſt falſe and abſurd. For if the ſoule were the bodie,<note place="margin">That the ſoule is no part of the bodie.</note> or any part thereof, it ſhould growe with the ſame, as the other partes of it doe; and the greater that the body were, the greater alſo ſhould the ſoule be. But expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience teacheth the contrarie; for when the bodie is at a certaine ſtay, and increaſeth no more, then doth the ſoule moſt grow, and they that are ſtrongeſt of mind, are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt of bodie; and the ſoule is ſeene to bee ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie liuely in a languiſhing bodie, and to grow the more in force, by the decaying of the body, that is, to increaſe the more in power &amp; ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. Therefore the ſoule groweth not with the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:15424:92"/>body, and is not the ſame nor any part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Againe, if the ſoule were the bodie, then ſhould ſhe looſe her ſoundneſſe with the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, ſo as the maimed in bodie ſhould feele a maime in his ſoule, the ſicke ſhould be ſicke in his reaſon, the blind ſhould haue a blind ſoule, and the lame a lame ſoule. But experience tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth the contrarie, wherefore the ſoule and the body be not all one,<note place="margin">That the ſoule is a ſubſtance.</note> neither is the ſoule a qualitie which hath his being in another thing; but a ſubſtance or life which cauſeth another thing to be, a forming ſubſtance, and a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall forme, which perfecteth the bodily ſubſtance, which outwardly ſeemeth to haue ſo many perfections; yea a ſpirituall and not a bodily ſubſtance, which comprehendeth hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth, time paſt, preſent, and to come, and is preſent in diuers places at once, which a bodie cannot doe, becauſe it hath certaine dimenſions; it cannot comprehend any thing which is not proportioned according to the greatneſſe and capacitie thereof: and therefore it is manifeſt alſo, that the ſoule is not any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall thing, becauſe matter receiueth not any forme or ſhape, but according to his owne quantitie, and but onely one forme at once, whereas the ſoule receiueth all formes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out quantitie, come there neuer ſo many at once, or ſo great, yea though they be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie formes. Theſe things conſidered, why
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:15424:93"/>ſhould we thinke, that the thing which becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the ſtronger by the weakneſſe of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and which is aduanced by the decay of the bodie, ſhould returne to duſt and die with the bodie? yea what is it that can kill the ſoule? Not contrarietie, for ſhe allodgeth all contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries equally in her ſelfe, yea in whom contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries abandon their contrarietie: Not want of food, for ſhe feedeth on the whole world; yea take the world from her, and ſhee feedeth at greateſt eaſe moſt agreeable to her owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Not violence, for the ſoule cannot bee puſhed at neither inwardly nor outwardly: Nor Death it ſelf, for ſhe ſeeketh life by Death. There is nothing then, that hath power againſt the ſoule of Man; and therefore it is immortal. Moreouer, who is that Man that deſireth not immortalitie? How could he deſire it if he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood not what it is? None of vs coueteth to be beginning-leſſe, for wee cannot compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend what it is, yea when we thinke vpon eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie without beginning, wee are at our wits end; becauſe none of vs is ſo, nor can bee: Whence comes this, but that our ſoules hauing had a beginning, cannot conceiue an eternitie without beginning, can yet being created im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall, they doe well conceiue an euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtingnes without end? If there be any that ſtil perſiſt in their Atheiſme, it cannot be but that they doe it againſt their owne conſcience, for

Wherfore for your comfort, and that you may attaine vnto this reſolution, I will inſiſt vpon one example, and apply the ſame vnto you particularly, if you will giue eare and marke it well. Dauid the King<note n="a" place="margin">2. Sa. 24.2</note> ſent Ioab to number all the people of Iſraell and Iudah, <hi>from Dan euen to Beer-ſheba;</hi>

                     <note n="b" place="margin">3</note>Ioab would diſſwade him from his purpoſe:<note n="c" place="margin">4</note> 
                     <hi>Notwithſtaending the Kings word preuailed againſt Ioab and againſt the Captaines of the hoaſt,</hi> ſo ſaith the Text. Well, the people were<note n="d" place="margin">9</note> numbred, and God was<note n="e" place="margin">11</note> therefore offended. Now to you: When you were firſt tempted to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſuch an heinous offence and foule deed as you haue done: Doubtleſſe the ſpirite would haue diſſwaded you from your euil intent, and your conſcience did pricke you, and ſhew you the grieuouſneſſe of the fact, notwithſtanding you gaue no eare to Ioab, to the ſpirit, and to your owne conſcience: but wilfully, hauing no regarde of your honeſtie, and credit, neither weying the anger of God, committed your ſelfe to the daunger, and perpetrated the fact, wherefore God is iuſtly offended with you. Then followeth the intent. What was Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids intent when hee cauſed the people to be numbered? Surely he meant no harme, but of Policie to number them,<note n="f" place="margin">2. Sa. 24.2</note> 
                     <hi>to know the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the people,</hi> that he might know his power. But what was your intent? The betraying of your country; the deſtruction of your Prince; The murdering of your Brother; the rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing of your neighbour; or ſuch like? You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not denie it: So then, if God was iuſtly angry with Dauid, how much more might he iuſtly condemne and vtterly forſake you? your fact being farre more horrible and wicked, then
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:15424:110"/>was the offence of Dauid. Now to Dauid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine; When<note n="g" place="margin">2. Sa. 24.9.</note> 
                     <hi>Ioab deliuered the number and ſum of the people vnto the king,</hi> all was well, thought Dauid. But alas, good man, it was not long ere God had awakened out of his ſleepe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to beſtirre himſelf. How then fared it with Dauid? then Dauids heart ſmote him, ſaith the text. Thus we ſee when ſinners promiſe moſt eaſe and reſt, moſt quietneſſe and plentie of Peace vnto themſelues, euen then beginneth the tragedie, when it is leaſt looked for. His heart was ſmitten: Oh in what a caſe was hee then! his heart aked, his ſpirite groaned, his ſoule bled, for ſorrow that he had ſo grieuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offended the Maieſtie of God; his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence cried out againſt him, Who can declare what things he felt within? yet was not his ſin ſo grieuous as yours. But what did he in this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonie? did he deſpaire? No, he humbled himſelf before the face of god, &amp; acknowledged his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, ſaying,<note n="h" place="margin">2. Sa. 24.10</note> I <hi>haue ſinned exceedingly in that</hi> I <hi>haue done, Therfore</hi> I <hi>beſeech thee now Lord, take away the treſpaſſe of thy ſeruant, for</hi> I <hi>haue done very fooliſhly.</hi> You heare how he ſtepped vnto the heauenly throane, humbly confeſſing his treſpaſſe, and deſiring forgiueneſſe and mercie, and therfore obtained mercie. But I pray you, when you had committed the deed, did you not thinke that all was well, that it ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue beene knowne? Ah, but ſweet meate
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:15424:110"/>muſt haue ſower ſauce. Well, when GOD had awakened, when you were taken, what remorſe of conſcience did you ſuffer? were you diſquieted in ſpirit, and ſorrie you offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded God, as Dauid was? If you were not, you ought to bee, the Lord giue you grace to doe ſo. It remaineth then, that you proſtrate your ſelf before the face of almighie God, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging your offences, and craue mercie and pardon for the ſame by the merits of Chriſt, and doubtleſſe you ſhal haue mercie as Dauid had. But how had Dauid mercie? The Lorde condemned him not (as he might iuſtly haue done) neither did hee vtterly forſake him, yet he puniſhed him, &amp; that moſt grieuouſly, with temporall puniſhment, by an offer that was made.

                     <hi>for his mercies are great,</hi> ſaith he) Bleſſed Dauid therefore. Euen ſo, it is not for you to bid the Lord battaile (as it were) by your im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paciencie, by your wailings and weepings, by your mutterings and murmurings, or by any other your diſcontentments, but after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Dauid, commend your ſelfe into the Lords hands, and truſt in his mercies, <hi>for his mercies are Great.</hi> Now to the puniſhment.<note n="o" place="margin">2.

Robert Glouer Martyr, in the time of Queen Marie, who after he was condemned by the Biſhop, and was now at a point to be deliuered out of this world, it ſo happened that two or three daies before, his
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:15424:157"/>heart being lumpiſh and deſolate of all ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all conſolation, felt in himſelfe no aptneſſe nor willingneſſe, but rather a heauineſſe and dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſpirit, full of much diſcomfort, to beare the bitter croſſe of Martyrdome ready now to to be laid vpon him. Wherevpon the fearing in himſelfe leſt the Lord had vtterly withdrawne his wonted fauour from him, made his mone to ſome friend of his, ſignifying vnto him how earneſtly he had praied day and night vnto the Lord, &amp; yet could receiue no motion or ſenſe of any comfort from him. Then his ſaid friend comforted him with Gods promiſes,<note place="margin">The Lord for a time may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, but at length he viſiteth againe his ſeruants.</note> aſſuring him in the truth thereof that he ſhould receiue comfort, when the Lord ſaw his due time: and therefore deſired him, whenſoeuer any ſuch feeling of Gods heauenly mercies, ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to touch his hart, that then he would ſhew ſome ſignification thereof, whereby he might witneſſe with him the ſame; and ſo departed from him. Now the next day, when the time came of his Martyrdome, as he was going to the place, and was now come to the ſight of the ſtake, although all the night before praying for ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth &amp; corage, he could feel none, ſo de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly he was ſo mightily repleniſhed with gods holy comfort and heauenly ioyes, that he cried out clapping his hands to his ſaid frind, &amp; ſaying in theſe words; <hi>He is come, he is come,</hi> &amp;c. and that with ſuch ioy and alacritie, as one ſeeming ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

No doubt, Dauid could tell what the children of God muſt doe in this caſe, himſelfe beeing ſo often plunged in this pit. The ſunne doth not alwaies ſhine vnto vs, for it is often couered with miſtie and darke cloudes, yea and euery day it ſetteth, and doth (as it were) take his leaue from vs as though it came no more.

The ſap of the tree doeth not alwaies aſcend to make it greene and flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but ſometimes it deſcendeth, yet it is not quite gone, but hideth it ſelfe in the roote for a time, and afterwards it returneth againe.

                  <p>SVrely there is no greater preheminence in Gods Church, then to bee a Martyr, nor more renowmed dignitie, than to die for the profeſſion of true Religion.

So the Martyrs firſt breake out of the dead ſleepe of originall ſinne, by repentance and faith in Chriſt; by feeding on the Sacraments &amp; leaues of Gods word, they grow to more ripeneſſe, caſting off the coate of worldly vanities &amp; earthly cares, and are cloathed with the ſilke of religion and ſinceritie of life, in which worke, perſeuering

It is like the buſh that burned, and was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed.

They want no means to ſearch out the truth, hauing both read and heard what can be ſaid on either ſide: They want not wit and iudgement, to diſcerne the good from the bad, being perſons knowne to be of deepe inſight &amp; diſcretion: They cleaue to the word of God only, and embrace the ſame, making it the onely touchſtone of truth, and the rule of their conſcience: They haue no pleaſure in paines, nor any temporall allurement to moue them to vndergo ſo great miſerie. Yea, they haue many delights, honors, &amp; promotions, to withdraw them from it. Surely, therefore it is that they find it neceſſarie to do this, and that their ſaluation lieth vppon it, or elſe fleſh and bloud could neuer digeſt theſe ſo heauy cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities; for otherwiſe for altering opinion, or ſpeaking a word, they might eaſily auoide it.

<pb n="302" facs="tcp:15424:164"/>as cheerefull minde as it is meante thee: Which, if Curteſie can not compel thee to do, yet will Chriſtianitie force thee; forſomuch as the Apoſtle ſaieth, that the Members of Chriſt be wiſe and of a good Nature.
